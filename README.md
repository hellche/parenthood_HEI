## Gender, Parenthood, and Academic Performance: Work-life and Work-work Balance in Russian Academia

This repository contains the code and data for the research article "Gender, Parenthood, and Academic Performance: Work-life and Work-work Balance in Russian Academia" by Elena Chechik, which has been submitted for presentation at the STI 2023 Conference. The study explores gender imbalances in Russian academia regarding work-life and work-work balance, focusing on parenthood.

The data for the study was obtained from a survey of 2,076 academic economists conducted in January 2021, as well as bibliometric data from the national citation base. The study discusses possible reasons for the lack of a statistically significant correlation between having children and the number of publications for men and women.
